			<h2>Why track your heart rate?</h2>
			<p>Your heart is the machine that powers your body. <br> It is amazingly efficient and powerful, but it will only beat so many times before it gives out.</p>
			<p>If you can lower your heart rate by 1 Beat Per Minute, you will save nearly 525,600 heart beats in 1 year. <br> At an average heart rate of 70 Beats Per Minute, that's 5 heart days of life.</p>
			<p>Imagine lowering your heart rate by 5 Beats Per minute. <br> You will save nearly 2,628,000 heart beats in 1 year. <br> That's 26 heart days of life, almost 1 month!</p>
