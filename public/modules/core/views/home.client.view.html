				<h2>Why track your heart rate?</h2>
				<p>Your heart is the machine that powers your body. <br> It is amazingly efficient and powerful, but it will only beat so many times before it gives out. <br> That is why it is important to do what you can to maintain a good heart rate.</p>
				<p>Generally speaking, a lower heart rate means a healthier heart. <br> And a healthier heart means better quality of life!</p>
				<p>Tracking your heart rate will allow you to see your progress or lack thereof over time. <br> It will then be easier for you to correlate which activities are leading you to a good heart rate.</p>

				<h2>The more you lower, the more you save</h2>
				<p>If you can lower your heart rate by 1 Beat Per Minute, you will save nearly 525,600 heart beats in 1 year. <br> At an average heart rate of 70 Beats Per Minute, that's 5 heart days of life.</p>
				<p>Imagine lowering your heart rate by 5 Beats Per minute. <br> You will save nearly 2,628,000 heart beats in 1 year. <br> That's 26 heart days of life, almost 1 month!</p>
				<p>Think about it. <br> With every beat you lower, you can save millions of beats over your lifetime. <br> That's years of heart life; and imagine the increase in your quality of life.
